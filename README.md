# 👋 Greetings... I'm Esthon.

(It sounds similar to "Ashton"!)

I'm a full-stack web developer, thinker, creative, and lifelong technology explorer.

I've been involved with information technology my whole life — starting with the TK-90 and MSX as a kid, and working professionally with software for over two decades. From disassembling electronics to sketching robots and writing games in BASIC, I’ve always sought ways to understand things and bring ideas to life.

I see software not just as code, but as a canvas — a way to create, to connect, and to challenge the way we think and see the world.

Outside of code, I dive into tabletop RPGs, fantasy lore, spirituality, and self-improvement — always chasing systems that help people think, create, and explore.

## 🌀 Tech Journey

Today, my path revolves around Web Development, with JavaScript as my spearhead (React, Node.js, and such), but I've explored many corners of tech and paradigms over the years. 

I’ve worked with scripting and automation, Linux server administration (former LPI certified), and mainframe systems using COBOL, JCL, Natural/Adabas, and virtualized environments. Around a decade ago, I delved into blockchain — building tools, writing Python code, Bash scripts (!), and contributing to crypto-related initiatives during their early surge. 

With the rise of AI, I've been exploring new forms of collaboration between humans and machines. I believe we’re entering a new chapter in software creation — one where tools think with us, not just for us, in synergy — and I aim to be an active force in this realm.

I’ve always had a natural drive to dive deep into emerging technologies — not just to follow trends, but to understand their potential, crossing boundaries, connecting disciplines,  and applying them meaningfully, using code as a medium to transform ideas into tangible experiences.
